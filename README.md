# Advanced-Programming-Project

The software analyzes mitochondrial genomes. 
Some of the analysis includes:
1. Calculating GC content and sequence statistics;
2. Identifying conserved motifs across sequences;
3. Performing pairwise sequence alignments;
4. Generating and analyzing mitochondrial DNA-derived data, such as motifs and alignment results.

The project includes a friendly web interface.
